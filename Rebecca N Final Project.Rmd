This is for the final exam project in EDRM 718.

### First we will load the package
```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

```

### Load the JP Demographics File
```{r}
JP_Demo <- read_csv("Job Prep Demographics.csv", skip = 6,
                    col_names = c("ID", "School", "Age", "Gender", "Discipline"),
                    JP_Demo$ID <- parse_integer(JP_Demo$ID))
                    
```

### Tidy and rename JP_Demo to Demographics File
```{r}
Demographics <- JP_Demo %>%
  fill("Discipline") %>%
  filter(ID >0)

```

### Double check that no ID numbers are repeated
```{r}
check_Demographics <- Demographics %>%
  count(ID) %>%
  filter(n >1)

```
#### Based on this check, we are certain that no ID numbers are repeated



#### What's Next
```{r}
