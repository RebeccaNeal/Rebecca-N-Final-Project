### Load and Tidy the Demographics File
```{r}
JP_Demo <- read_csv("Job Prep Demographics.csv", skip = 6,
                    col_names = c("ID", "School", "Age", "Gender", "Discipline"),
                    JP_Demo$ID <- parse_integer(JP_Demo$ID))
                    
```

### Tidy and rename JP_Demo to Demographics File

Demographics <- JP_Demo %>%
  fill("Discipline") %>%
  filter(ID >0)
